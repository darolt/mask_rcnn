        this percent even if min_dim doesn't require it.
    mode: Resizing mode.
        none: No resizing. Return the image unchanged.
        square: Resize and pad with zeros to get a square image
            of size [max_dim, max_dim].
        pad64: Pads width and height with zeros to make them multiples of 64.
               If min_dim or min_scale are provided, it scales the image up
               before padding. max_dim is ignored in this mode.
               The multiple of 64 is needed to ensure smooth scaling of feature
               maps up and down the 6 levels of the FPN pyramid (2**6=64).
        crop: Picks random crops from the image. First, scales the image based
              on min_dim and min_scale, then picks a random crop of
              size min_dim x min_dim. Can be used in training only.
              max_dim is not used in this mode.

    Returns:
    image: the resized image
    window: (y1, x1, y2, x2). If max_dim is provided, padding might
        be inserted in the returned image. If so, this window is the
        coordinates of the image part of the full image (excluding
        the padding). The x2, y2 pixels are not included.
    scale: The scale factor used to resize the image
    padding: Padding added to the image [(top, bottom), (left, right), (0, 0)]
